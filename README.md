# Tailwind Slate Mock
As part of my work routine I've set my Q4 '19 goal to get acquainted with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
After watching the screencasts created by [Adam Wathan](https://adamwathan.me) I've tried to copy his working technique 
of implementing an UI from design. With one small difference, whereas Adam works from an interface drafted in Sketch by 
[Steve Schoger](https://www.steveschoger.com). I'm trying to build an existing UI using Tailwind CSS. For this I've 
chosen [Slate](https://slatedocs.github.io/slate/#introduction)

# Reflection
As an software engineer more focused on the backend I've always found that CSS didn't click with me. However 
the way Tailwind offers a single source of documentation, it's screencasts and how it offers an "API" to build the UI 
makes it logically for me that it was before. 
After watching the screencast I now have some basic process which I can follow and apply myself resulting in a Tailwind
version of the Slate UI. As my intent was not to recreate the Slate app with all features But instead focus on the 
UI part, this resulted in a partial UI without functionalities. All in all I'm very pleased with the result and feel 
confident I can get easily up to speed with Tailwind CSS if needed in any future project.
On personal projects I would prefer tailwind over Bootstrap as to me it feels more intuitive. Which maybe only the result
of the combination of documentation and screencasts or that fact that I've done a deep dive into a CSS framework.
