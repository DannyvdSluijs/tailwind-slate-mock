# Tailwind Slate Mock
As part of my work routine I've set my Q4 '19 goal to get acquainted with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
After watching the screencasts created by [Adam Wathan](https://adamwathan.me) I've tried to copy his working technique 
of implementing an UI from design. With one small difference, whereas Adam works from an interface drafted in Sketch by 
[Steve Schoger](https://www.steveschoger.com). I'm trying to build an existing UI using Tailwind CSS. For this I've 
chosen to recreate the [Slate](https://slatedocs.github.io/slate/#introduction) interface.

# Running
In a terminal launch the vue cli service using `npm run serve`. After some seconds there will some feedback with
the available network addresses the app is running at. Typically [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/)

# Reflection
As an software engineer more focused on the backend I've always found that CSS didn't click with me. However 
the way Tailwind offers a single source of documentation, it's screencasts and how it offers an "API" to build the UI 
makes it logically for me that it was before. 

After watching the screencast I now have some basic process which I can follow and apply myself resulting in a Tailwind
version of the Slate UI. As my intent was not to recreate the Slate app with all features But instead focus on the 
UI part, which resulted in a partial UI without functionalities. Also the colouring and grid sizes are off which I've 
intentionally left behind. Reading through the documentation I've found that Tailwind CSS allows you to reconfigure the
colours as well as the grid size (and everything else) which made it for me not the top priority.

All in all I'm very pleased with the result and feel confident I can get easily up to speed with Tailwind CSS if needed
in any future project.

On personal projects I would prefer tailwind over Bootstrap as to me it feels more intuitive. Which maybe only the result
of the combination of documentation and screencasts or that fact that I've done a deep dive into a CSS framework. One 
downside that should be mentioned that compared to Bootstrap the setup might take a bit longer but since that is only a 
one time thing it is worth the effort.
